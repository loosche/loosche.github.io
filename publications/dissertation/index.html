		<h4>Abstract:</h4>
		<p class="abstract">
			Indirect illumination is a highly desirable feature
			of realism in computer generated imagery. However, its global nature
			makes it difficult to compute in real-time. Despite the difficulty,
			many games are currently attempting to produce global illumination
			solutions using varying techniques. Most are simple techniques, unlike
			the fully dynamic systems talked about in academia. Games generally use
			precomputed global illumination stored in light maps (otherwise known
			as static baked global lighting) or ambient occlusion as well as
			placing nonshadowing static lights to fill in areas of shadow.
			<br/><br/>
			In live-action films, reflectors and bounce cards
			are used to reflect additional light back into the scene. These planes
			and simple shapes only approximate indirect light from geometry in the
			real-world, but offer a high level of control that allow directors of
			photography to produce desired results. In digital film production,
			simple-shaped lights are commonly used to allow artists to quickly
			iterate and achieve a desired look. The ease-of-use and controllability
			of these approximations outweighs their physically incorrect
			nature.
			<br/><br/>
			We believe that by following this insight we have
			created a new, simple, global illumination method that could be applied
			to current games, where global illumination is to be decomposed and
			calculated on simple shapes and then reconstructed to generate pleasing
			visual results.  We have developed a technique that creates a set of
			bases in which we calculate indirect lighting. Our approach is very
			efficient and uses very little data and a quick, one-time,
			scene-independent precomputation step. It also allows real-time
			computation of approximate indirect light and is designed with rapid
			iteration of light design in mind. We precompute light transport
			operators (LTOs) for a handful of simple canonical “shapes,” then
			interactively warp and combine these shapes, along with their LTOs, to
			more complex geometry. These shape proxies are used to model
			direct-to-indirect transport, which is then applied as a light map to
			the actual scene geometry. The flow of indirect light between shapes is
			modeled with lightfields, and all computations are performed in very
			low-dimensional subspaces (Chapter 3: Modular Radiance Transfer). We
			generate another set of LTOs to capture the finer details onto, off of,
			and blocked by objects within our dictionary (Chapter 5: Delta Radiance
			Transfer). To improve the visual results of these low-frequency
			calculations we also introduce a novel screen space ambient occlusion
			method called Volumetric Obscurance (Chapter 6) that, when paired with
			MRT and DRT, generates visually plausible, real-time (on the order of
			milliseconds) indirect illumination.
			<br/><br/>
			Modular Radiance Transfer (MRT), Delta Radiance
			Transfer (DRT), and Volumetric Obscurance (VO) result in plausible,
			dynamic global-illumination effects, rendering at high frame rates with
			low memory overhead. Our methods have been shown to scale from high-end
			to mobile platforms and, like precomputed radiance transfer (PRT),
			provide smooth results that respond to dynamic changes in lighting.
